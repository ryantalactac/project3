## You need to answer the following question. 
Two binary search trees contains exactly the same number of entries of student information but in different orders.
Do they give the same performance in terms of key searching or firstname searching? if not, why? use the data you obtain from you code to 
explain your answer. 


They do not offer the same performance. 
In the case of our projects the data/keys were alphabetized in datafile1. This made the tree unbalanced and it made it heavily one sided. In datafile2 it was more balanced due to the fact that their were some keys that are smaller then the first key given. In the alphabetized list we saw that the keys after the first one were larger so it made an unbalanced tree and it ultimately led to more steps to find steven.
